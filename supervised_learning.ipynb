        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose?\n",
        "   - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) models the relationship between one independent variable and one dependent variable using a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Its purpose is to predict the output variable and understand how changes in the input affect the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "   - Key assumptions are:\n",
        "\n",
        "      **1.** Linear relationship between X and Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "      **2.** Errors are independent, normally distributed, and have constant variance (homoscedasticity).\n",
        "\n",
        "      **3.** No significant outliers influencing the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and\n",
        "explain each term.\n",
        "    - The equation is: y = β₀ + β₁x + ε\n",
        "\n",
        "      β₀ → Intercept (value of y when x = 0)\n",
        "\n",
        "      β₁ → Slope (change in y for each unit change in x)\n",
        "\n",
        "      ε → Error term (unexplained variation)\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be\n",
        "applied.\n",
        "    *   A real-world example is predicting a house price based on its square footage. As the area increases, the price tends to rise, and SLR can model this relationship with a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "   - The method of least squares finds the best-fit line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the actual values and the predicted values. It ensures the line fits the data as closely as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "   - Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that predicts probabilities for categorical outcomes (e.g., 0/1).\n",
        "\n",
        "      Unlike Linear Regression, which predicts continuous values, Logistic Regression uses the sigmoid function to output probabilities between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression\n",
        "models.\n",
        "     - **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "\n",
        "        **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Squares errors before averaging, penalizing larger mistakes more.\n",
        "\n",
        "        **R² Score:** Shows how much variance in the target is explained by the model (closer to 1 is better).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "     - R-squared measures how much of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the model. A higher R² indicates a better fit of the regression line to the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  Write Python code to fit a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn and print the slope and intercept.\n",

        "\n",
        "        The intercept (β₀) is the predicted value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is 0.\n",
